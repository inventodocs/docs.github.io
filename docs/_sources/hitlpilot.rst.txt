Pilot - HITL
------------

**Overview:**

This Document consists of Driving and monitoring using HITL(Humans In the Loop). Our robots connect to configured wifi automatically and available on freedom robotics dashboard for remote controllability and monitorability.  HITL pilot can view camera feed and able to drive the robot using keyboards and virtual joystick on the dashboard. We welcome the suggestions for any improvement in the documentation for fellow pilots. 

**Prerequisites:**

#. Need a Windows/Linux/Mac PC with Google Chrome installed. 
#. Get a username and password from Admin and log into Freedom robotics website. 

**Benefits of HITL approach with Freedom Robotics:**

One of the issues with the HITL approach is that the human can help guide the robot when it gets stuck. It is common for a robot to lose its current position on a map and think it is somewhere else. This is known as “loss of localization”. With the HITL approach, the operator will be able to use the freedom dashboard and manually “re-localize” the robot, i.e. update the position of the robot with respect to the map
